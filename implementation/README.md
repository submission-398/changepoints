## Reference Implementation
We provide a reference implementation of our approach in the file [change_point_identification.py](change_point_identification.py) along with an example to initialize the synthesizer and run the algorithm.

The file contains two classes. The class ``Synthesizer`` is used to synthesize and retrieve performance data for a controlled experiment setup. The class ``ChangePointLearner`` implements the learning algorithm. 

The file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) contains a list of dependencies. These can be installed, for instance with pip via ``pip3 install -r requirements.txt``.
