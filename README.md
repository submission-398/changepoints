## Identifying Software Performance Changes Across Variants and Versions
On this companion website we provide the supplementary material to our submission, in particular regarding the evaluation. For our controlled experimental setup, we provide a reference implementation of our approach in Python as well as additional visualizations not included in the paper submission due to spatial limitations. For our experiment wirh real-world data, we provide a detailed description of the three software systems and benchmarks used to assess performance. We provide the feature model, i.e., the set of constraints among configuration options of all three systems. The performance measurement data can be found here as well.
